# Assert

## Under Construction

Ever wonder how we maintain such strict parity between @re-/type's runtime behavior, its inferred types, and TypeScript's own definitions?

Given the unprecedented scope of @re-/type as a project whose types are as important as its functionality, we found ourselves in need of a unit testing framework designed to test them together.

From a single statement, @re-/assert allows you to make assertions about types, values or both:

```ts
assert(o).equals({ re: "do" }).typed as { re: string }
```

We're actively relying on @re-/assert for hundreds of tests in @re-/type, but still need to freeze the API and add documentation.
