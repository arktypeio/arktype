# State

## Under Construction

We're working hard on a new tool that uses [models](/model) to make states that can manage themselves.

Think Redux but with less boilerplate, more flexibility, and implicit validation.

If you want to learn more, the project is tracked [here](https://github.com/re-do/re-po/projects/1).
