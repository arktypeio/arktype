# Declarations

Like keeping your files small and tidy? Perhaps you'd prefer to split your definitions up.

Try a **declaration**.

<div
    style={{
        width: "100%",
        height: "730px",
        border: 0,
        marginLeft: -8,
        marginRight: -8,
        padding: 16,
        overflow: "hidden",
        borderRadius: 8
    }}
>
    <StackBlitzDemo embedId="declaration" addonFiles={["user", "group"]} />
</div>
