[ArkType](https://arktype.io) syntax highlighting and themeâ›µ

</div>

We're building a 1:1 validator for TypeScript! Check out our core project [on GitHub](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype)!

## Features

- syntax highlighting for strings that are part of an ArkType definition

- inline type error summaries optimized for ArkType via [ErrorLens](https://github.com/usernamehw/vscode-error-lens)

- optional editor theme based on ArkType palette and optimized for type syntax

The low-poly animal backgrounds from these images are not part of the theme but are images from [this theme](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pbdb440swlc?hl=en-tc&gl=TC) rendered using the excellent [Background](https://github.com/KatsuteDev/Background) extension by [@Katsute](https://github.com/Katsute).

## Contributing

**Run > Debugger** (`F5` by default) will launch the extension in another window, allowing you to see the effects of your changes on whatever code you open in it.

#### Update the ArkDark theme palette

See [color-theme.json](/ark/dark/color-theme.json)

> [!NOTE]  
> Changes will be immediately reflected in the extension host window

#### Update syntax highlighting rules

See [injected.tmLanguage.json](/ark/dark/injected.tmLanguage.json)

To determine which scopes need to be changed, you can view scopes applied to any file in VSCode by opening the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P by default) and searching "Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes".

Changes to `injected.tmLanguage.json` should be mirrored to [tsWithArkType.tmLanguage.json](./tsWithArkType.tmLanguage.json).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must reload the extension host window to see scope changes reflected
