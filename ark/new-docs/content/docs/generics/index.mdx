### Keywords

Record is now available as a builtin keyword.

```ts twoslash
import { type } from "arktype"

const stringRecord = type("Record<string, string>")
```

In addition to `Record`, the following generics from TS are now available in ArkType:

- **Pick**
- **Omit**
- **Extract**
- **Exclude**

These can be instantiated in one of three ways:

```ts twoslash
import { type, type Type } from "arktype"

const createBox = <T extends string>(of: type.Any<T>) =>
	type({
		box: of
	})

const boxType = createBox(type("string"))
//    ^?

// @ts-expect-error
const badBox = createBox(type("number"))

console.log(boxType({ box: 5 }).toString())
console.log(boxType({ box: "foo" }))
```

### Syntax

#### Definition

```ts twoslash
import { type } from "arktype"

const boxOf = type("<t>", { box: "t" })

// hover me!
const schrodingersBox = boxOf({ cat: { isAlive: "boolean" } })
```

#### Constrained Parameters

All syntax in parameters definitions and all references to generic args are fully-type safe and autocompleted like any builtin keyword. Constraints can be used just like TS to limit what can be passed to a generic and allow that arg to be used with operators like `>`.

```ts twoslash
import { type } from "arktype"

const nonEmpty = type("<arr extends unknown[]>", "arr > 0")

const nonEmptyNumberArray = nonEmpty("number[]")
```

#### Scoped

There is a special syntax for specifying generics in a scope:

```ts twoslash
import { scope } from "arktype"

const types = scope({
	"box<t, u>": {
		box: "t | u"
	},
	bitBox: "box<0, 1>"
}).export()

const out = types.bitBox({ box: 0 })
```

#### Invocation

```ts twoslash
import { type } from "arktype"

const one = type("Extract<0 | 1, 1>")
```

##### Chained

```ts twoslash
import { type } from "arktype"

const user = type({
	name: "string",
	"age?": "number",
	isAdmin: "boolean"
})

// hover me!
const basicUser = user.pick("name", "age")
```

#### Invoked

```ts twoslash
import { type } from "arktype"

const unfalse = type.keywords.Exclude("boolean", "false")
```

### HKT

Our new generics have been built using a new method for integrating arbitrary external types as native ArkType generics! This opens up tons of possibilities for external integrations that would otherwise not be possible. As a preview, here's what the implementation of `Partial` looks like internally:

```ts twoslash
import { generic, Hkt } from "arktype"

const Partial = generic(["T", "object"])(
	args => args.T.partial(),
	class PartialHkt extends Hkt<[object]> {
		declare body: Partial<this[0]>
	}
)
```

Recursive and cyclic generics are also currently unavailable and will be added soon.

For more usage examples, check out the unit tests for generics [here](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/blob/main/ark/type/__tests__/generic.test.ts).

This feature was built to be very robust and flexible. We're excited to see what you do with it!
