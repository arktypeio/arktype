TypeScript is extremely versatile for representing types like `string` or `number`, but what about `email` or `integer less than 100`?

In ArkType, conditions that narrow a type beyond its **basis** are called **constraints**.

Constraints are a first-class citizen of ArkType. They are fully composable with TypeScript's built-in operators and governed by the same underlying principles of set-theory.

In other words, **they just work**.

## Define

Let's create a new `contact` Type that enforces our example constraints.

```ts twoslash
// hover to see the type-level representation
const contact = type({
	// many common constraints are available as built-in keywords
	email: "string.email",
	// others can be written as type-safe expressions
	score: "number.integer < 100"
})

// if you need the TS type, just infer it out as normal
type Contact = typeof contact.infer
// This should cut but it isn't working as expected

// this empty line prevents the source syntax highlighting from breaking
```

## Compose

Imagine we want to define a new Type representing a non-empty list of `Contact`.

While the expression syntax we've been using is ideal for creating new types, chaining is a great way to refine or transform existing ones.

```ts twoslash
const _contact = type({
	email: "string.email",
	score: "number.integer < 100"
})

type _Contact = typeof _contact.t

interface Contact extends _Contact {}

export const contact: type<Contact> = _contact
// ---cut-start---
// a non-empty list of Contact
// ---cut-end---
const contacts = contact.array().atLeastLength(1)
```

## Narrow

Structured constraints like divisors and ranges will only take us so far. Luckily, they integrate seamlessly with whatever custom validation logic you need.

```ts twoslash
const palindromicEmail = type("string.email").narrow((address, ctx) => {
	if (address === [...address].reverse().join("")) {
		// congratulations! your email is somehow a palindrome
		return true
	}
	// add a customizable error and return false
	return ctx.mustBe("a palindrome")
})

const palindromicContact = type({
	email: palindromicEmail,
	score: "number.integer < 100"
})
```

We can invoke `palindromicContact` anywhere to get validated data or a list of errors with a user-friendly summary.

```ts twoslash
const palindromicEmail = type("string.email").narrow((address, ctx) => {
	if (address === [...address].reverse().join("")) {
		// congratulations! your email is somehow a palindrome
		return true
	}
	// add a customizable error and return false
	return ctx.mustBe("a palindrome")
})

const palindromicContact = type({
	email: palindromicEmail,
	score: "number.integer < 100"
})

interface RuntimeErrors extends type.errors {
	/**email must be a palindrome (was "david@arktype.io")
score (133.7) must be...
  • an integer
  • less than 100*/
	summary: string
}

const narrowMessage = (e: type.errors): e is RuntimeErrors => true
// ---cut-start---
const out = palindromicContact({
	email: "david@arktype.io",
	score: 133.7
})
// ---cut-end---

if (out instanceof type.errors) {
	// ---cut-start---
	if (!narrowMessage(out)) throw new Error()
	// ---cut-end---
	// hover summary to see validation errors
	console.error(out.summary)
} else {
	console.log(out.email)
}
```

You now know how to refine your types to enforce additional constraints at runtime.

But what if once your input is fully validated, you still need to make some adjustments before it's ready to use?

The final section of intro will cover **morphs**, an extremely powerful tool for composing and transforming Types.
