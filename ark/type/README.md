<h3 align="center"><i>TypeScript's 1:1 validator, optimized from editor to runtime</i></h1>

ArkType is a runtime validation library that parses optimized validators from familiar, type-safe syntax.

It can be used to check external data like JSON payloads or forms at the boundaries of your code (similar to Zod or Yup).

## Contributions

We accept and encourage pull requests from outside ArkType. Planned work is tracked in [this GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/arktypeio/projects/4).

Depending on your level of familiarity with type systems and TS generics, some parts of the codebase may be hard to jump into. That said, there's plenty of opportunities for more straightforward contributions. We'd generally recommend starting with one of these issues labeled [external-contributor-friendly](https://github.com/orgs/arktypeio/projects/4/?filterQuery=label%3A%22external-contributor-friendly%22).

If you're planning on submitting a non-trivial fix or a new feature, please [create an issue first](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/new) so everyone's on the same page. The last thing we want is for you to spend time on a submission we're unable to merge.

When you're ready, check out our [guide](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started!
