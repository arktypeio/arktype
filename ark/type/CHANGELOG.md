## 2.1.0

### `match`

The `match` function provides a powerful way to handle different types of input and return corresponding outputs based on the input type, like a type-safe `switch` statement.

#### Case Record API

The simplest way to define a matcher is with ArkType definition strings as keys with corresponding handlers as values:

```ts
import { match } from "arktype"

const sizeOf = match({
	"string | Array": v => v.length,
	number: v => v,
	bigint: v => v,
	default: "assert"
})

// a match definition is complete once a `default` has been specified,
// either as a case or via the .default() method

sizeOf("abc") // 3
sizeOf([1, 2, 3, 4]) // 4
sizeOf(5n) // 5n
// ArkErrors: must be an object, a string, a number or a bigint (was boolean)
sizeOf(true)
```

In this example, `sizeOf` is a matcher that takes a string, array, number, or bigint as input. It returns the length of strings and arrays, and the value of numbers and bigints.

`default` accepts one of 4 values:

- `"assert"`: accept `unknown`, throw if none of the cases match
- `"never"`: accept an input based on inferred cases, throw if none match
- `"reject"`: accept `unknown`, return `ArkErrors` if none of the cases match
- `(data: In) => unknown`: handle data not matching other cases directly

Cases will be checked in the order they are specified, either as object literal keys or via chained methods.

#### Fluent API

The `match` function also provides a fluent API. This can be convenient for non-string-embeddable definitions:

```ts
// the Case Record and Fluent APIs can be easily combined
const sizeOf = match({
	string: v => v.length,
	number: v => v,
	bigint: v => v
})
	// match any object with a numeric length property and extract it
	.case({ length: "number" }, o => o.length)
	// return 0 for all other data
	.default(() => 0)

sizeOf("abc") // 3
sizeOf({ name: "David", length: 5 }) // 5
sizeOf(null) // 0
```

#### Narrowing input with `in`, property matching with `at`

```ts
type Data =
	| {
			id: 1
			oneValue: number
	  }
	| {
			id: 2
			twoValue: string
	  }

const discriminateValue = match
	// .in allows you to specify the input TypeScript allows for your matcher
	.in<Data>()
	// .at allows you to specify a key at which your input will be matched
	.at("id")
	.match({
		1: o => `${o.oneValue}!`,
		2: o => o.twoValue.length,
		default: "assert"
	})

discriminateValue({ id: 1, oneValue: 1 }) // "1!"
discriminateValue({ id: 2, twoValue: "two" }) // 3
discriminateValue({ oneValue: 3 })
```

### Builtin keywords can now be globally configured

This can be very helpful for customizing error messages without needing to create your own aliases or wrappers.

```ts title="config.ts"
import { configure } from "arktype/config"

configure({
	keywords: {
		string: "shorthand description",
		"string.email": {
			actual: () => "definitely fake"
		}
	}
})
```

```ts title="app.ts"
import "./config.ts"
import { type } from "arktype"

const user = type({
	name: "string",
	email: "string.email"
})

const out = user({
	// ArkErrors: name must be shorthand description (was a number)
	name: 5,
	// ArkErrors: email must be an email address (was definitely fake)
	email: "449 Canal St"
})
```

The options you can provide here are identical to those used to [configure a Type directly](https://arktype.io/docs/expressions#meta), and can also be [extended at a type-level to include custom metadata](https://arktype.io/docs/configuration#custom).

### Tuple and args expressions for `.to`

If a morph returns an `ArkErrors` instance, validation will fail with that result instead of it being treated as a value. This is especially useful for using other Types as morphs to validate output or chain transformations.

To make this easier, there's a special `to` operator that can pipe to a parsed definition without having to wrap it in `type` to make it a function.

This was added before 2.0, but now it comes with a corresponding operator (`|>`) so that it can be expressed via a tuple or args like most other expressions:

```ts
const fluentStillWorks = type("string.numeric.parse").to("number % 2")

const nowSoDoesTuple = type({
	someKey: ["string.numeric.parse", "|>", "number % 2"]
})

const andSpreadArgs = type("string.numeric.parse", "|>", "number % 2")
```

### Error configurations now accept a string directly

```ts
const customOne = type("1", "@", {
	// previously only a function returning a string was allowed here
	message: "Yikes."
})

// ArkErrors: Yikes.
customOne(2)
```

Keep in mind, [as mentioned in the docs](https://arktype.io/docs/configuration#errors), error configs like `message` can clobber more granular config options like `expected` and `actual` and cannot be included in composite errors e.g. for a union.

Though generally, returning a string based on context is the best option, in situations where you always want the same static message, it's now easier to get that!

### Type.toString() now wraps its syntactic representation in `Type<..>`

Previously, `Type.toString()` just returned `Type.expression`. However, in contexts where the source of a message isn't always a `Type`, it could be confusing:

```ts
// < 2.1.0:  "(was string)"
// >= 2.1.0: "(was Type<string>)"
console.log(`(was ${type.string})`)
```

Hopefully if you interpolate a Type, you'll be less confused by the result from now on!

### Improve how Type instances are inferred when wrapped in external generics

Previously, we used `NoInfer` in some Type method returns. After migrating those to inlined conditionals, we get the same benefit and external inference for cases like this is more reliable:

```ts
function fn<
	T extends {
		schema: StandardSchemaV1
	}
>(_: T) {
	return {} as StandardSchemaV1.InferOutput<T["schema"]>
}

// was inferred as unknown (now correctly { name: string })
const arkRes = fn({
	schema: type({
		name: "string"
	})
})
```

### Fix an issue causing some discriminated unions to incorrectly reject default cases

```ts
const discriminated = type({
	id: "0",
	k1: "number"
})
	.or({ id: "1", k1: "number" })
	.or({
		name: "string"
	})

// previously, this was rejected as requiring a "k1" key

// will now hit the case discriminated for id: 1,
// but still correctly be allowed via the { name: string } branch
discriminated({ name: "foo", id: 1 }))
```

## 2.0.4

### Fix an issue causing global configs to be overwritten when the primary `"arktype"` entry point is imported:

`config.ts`

```ts
import { configure } from "arktype/config"

configure({ numberAllowsNaN: true })
```

`main.ts`

```ts
import "./config.ts"
import { type } from "arktype"
// now correctly allows NaN
type.number.allows(Number.NaN)
```

Previous versions of the docs mistakenly suggested this was possible in a single file. This is not the case in ESM due to hoisting. See the updated global configuration docs [here](https://arktype.io/docs/expressions#brand).

### Better `ParseError` when attempting to constraint a morph

Previously, attempting to directly constrain a transformed type was not a type error but gave a confusing error at runtime:

```ts
// ParseError: MinLength operand must be a string or an array (was never)
type("string.trim > 2")
```

We've added a type error and improved the runtime error:

```ts
// TypeScript: To constrain the output of string.trim, pipe like myMorph.to('number > 0')
// ParseError: MinLength operand must be a string or an array (was a morph)
type("string.trim > 2")
```

### Fix an issue causing certain complex morph types to not infer output correctly, e.g.:

```ts
const types = type.module({
	From: { a: ["1", "=>", () => 2] },
	Morph: ["From", "=>", e => e],
	To: { a: "2" }
})
const U = types.Morph.pipe(e => e, types.To)

// was:
//    (In: never) => To<{ a: 2 }>
// now fixed to:
//    { a: 2 }
const out = U.assert({ a: 1 })
```

## 2.0.2

- Fix an issue where type-altering (currently config options `numberAllowsNan`, `dateAllowsInvalid` and `onUndeclaredKey`) could be specified at a scope-level, leading to unintuitive cache results ([#1255](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/1255))
