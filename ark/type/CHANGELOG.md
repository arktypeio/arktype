- Fix an issue causing certain complex morph types to not infer output correctly, e.g.:

```ts
const types = type.module({
	From: { a: ["1", "=>", () => 2] },
	Morph: ["From", "=>", e => e],
	To: { a: "2" }
})
const U = types.Morph.pipe(e => e, types.To)

// was:
//    (In: never) => To<{ a: 2 }>
// now fixed to:
//    { a: 2 }
const out = U.assert({ a: 1 })
```

## 2.0.3

- Fix an issue causing some unions with `onUndeclaredKey: "reject"` to reject valid data ([#1266](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/1266))

- Fix an issue where Types containing arrays were incorrectly treated as including morphs, leading to some unnecessary validation overhead ([#1268](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/1268#issuecomment-2613551907))

- Fix an issue causing objects containing functions like `() => never` that are subtypes of `InferredMorph` to be incorrectly treated as morphs ([#1264](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/1264))

- Fail early with a `ParseError` if `instanceOf` operand is not actually a function at runtime ([#1262](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/1262))

## 2.0.2

- Fix an issue where type-altering (currently config options `numberAllowsNan`, `dateAllowsInvalid` and `onUndeclaredKey`) could be specified at a scope-level, leading to unintuitive cache results ([#1255](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/1255))

## 2.0.1

- Fix `@ark/util` version specifier

## 2.0.0

- Initial stable release 🎉
