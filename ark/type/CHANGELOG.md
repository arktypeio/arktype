# arktype

## 2.0.3

- Fix an issue causing some unions with `onUndeclaredKey: "reject"` rejecting valid data ([#1266](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/1266))

- Fix an issue where Types containing arrays were incorrectly treated as including morphs, leading to some unnecessary validation overhead ([#1268](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/1268#issuecomment-2613551907))

- Fix an issue causing objects containing functions like `() => never` that are subtypes of `InferredMorph` to be incorrectly treated as morphs ([#1264](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/1264))

- Fail early with a `ParseError` if `instanceOf` operand is not actually a function at runtime ([#1262](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/1262))

## 2.0.2

- Fix an issue where type-altering (currently config options `numberAllowsNan`, `dateAllowsInvalid` and `onUndeclaredKey`) could be specified at a scope-level, leading to unintuitive cache results ([#1255](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/1255))
