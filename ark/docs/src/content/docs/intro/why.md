## Why use it?

- **Performance**:
  - In editor: Types are 3x more efficient than Zod
  - At runtime: 400x faster than Zod, 2000x faster than Yup
- **Concision**:
  - Definitions: About 1/2 as long as equivalent Zod on average
  - Types: Tooltips are 1/5 the length of Zod on average
- **Portability**:
  - Definitions are just strings and objects and are serializable by default.
- **Developer Experience**:
  - With semantic validation and contextual autocomplete, ArkType's static parser is unlike anything you've ever seen.
