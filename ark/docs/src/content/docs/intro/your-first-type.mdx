import { TypeBenchmarksGraph } from "../../../components/BenchmarksGraph.tsx"

If you already know TypeScript, congratulations! You just learned most of ArkType's syntax ðŸŽ‰

```ts
// @noErrors
import { type } from "arktype"
// prettier-ignore
// ---cut---
const user = type({
	name: "string",
	platform: "'android' | 'ios'",
	"version?": "number | s"
	//                     ^|
})
```

If you make a mistake, don't worry- every definition gets the autocomplete and validation you're used to in your editor, all from within TypeScript's type system!

:::note[Will ArkType crash my TypeScript server?]
A huge amount of optimization has gone into making validating native type syntax not just feasible, but often much faster than alternatives.

```ts
import { type } from "arktype"

// Definitions are statically parsed and inferred as TS.
export const user = type({
	name: "string",
	device: {
		platform: "'android'|'ios'",
		"version?": "number"
	}
})

// Validators return typed data or clear, customizable errors.
export const out = user({
	name: "Alan Turing",
	device: {
		// errors.summary: "device/platform must be 'android' or 'ios' (was 'enigma')"
		platform: "enigma"
	}
})

if (out instanceof type.errors) {
	// a clear, user-ready error message, even for complex unions and intersections
	console.log(out.summary)
} else {
	// your valid data!
	console.log(out)
}
```
