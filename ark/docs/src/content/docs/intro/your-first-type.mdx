If you already know TypeScript, congratulations- you just learned most of ArkType's syntax ðŸŽ‰

## Define

```ts
import { type } from "arktype"

const user = type({
	name: "string",
	platform: "'android' | 'ios'",
	"versions?": "(number | string)[]"
})

// extract the type if needed
type User = typeof user.infer
```

If you make a mistake, don't worry- every definition gets the autocomplete and validation you're used to from your editor, all within TypeScript's type system.

:::note[Will ArkType crash my TypeScript server?]
Thousands of hours of optimization have gone into making validating native type syntax not just feasible, but often much faster than alternatives âš¡

## Compose

Suppose we want to move `platform` and `version` from our original type to a new `device` property.

```ts
const user = type({
	name: "string",
	// nested definitions don't need to be wrapped
	device: {
		platform: "'android' | 'ios'",
		"versions?": "(number | string)[]"
	}
})
```

To decouple `device` from `user`, just move it to its own type and reference it.

```ts
const device = type({
	platform: "'android' | 'ios'",
	"versions?": "(number | string)[]"
})

const user = type({
	name: "string",
	device: device
})
```

## Validate

At runtime, we can pass `unknown` data to our type and get back either a validated `User` or an array of clear, customizable errors with a root `summary`.

```ts
const user = type({
	name: "string",
	device: {
		platform: "'android' | 'ios'",
		"versions?": "(number | string)[]"
	}
})

interface RuntimeErrors extends type.errors {
	/**device.platform must be "android" or "ios" (was "enigma")
device.versions[2] must be a number or a string (was bigint)*/
	summary: string
}

const narrowMessage = (e: type.errors): e is RuntimeErrors => true

// ---cut---
const out = user({
	name: "Alan Turing",
	device: {
		platform: "enigma",
		versions: [0, "1", 0n]
	}
})

if (out instanceof type.errors) {
	// ---cut-start---
	// just a trick to display the runtime error
	if (!narrowMessage(out)) throw new Error()
	// ---cut-end---
	// hover out.summary to see validation errors
	console.error(out.summary)
} else {
	// hover out to see your validated data
	console.log(`Hello, ${out.name}`)
}
```

And that's it! You now know how to to define a `Type` use it to check your data at runtime.

Next, we'll take a look at how ArkType extends TypeScript's type system to handle runtime constraints like `maxLength` and `pattern`.
