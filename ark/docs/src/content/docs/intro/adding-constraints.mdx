TypeScript is extremely versatile for representing types like `string` or `number`, but what about `email` or `integer less than 100`?

In ArkType, conditions that narrow a type beyond its **basis** are called **constraints**.

Constraints are a first-class citizen of ArkType. They are fully composable with TypeScript's built-in operators and governed by the same underlying principles of set-theory.

In other words, **they just work**.

## Define

Let's create a new `contact` Type that enforces our example constraints.

```ts
import { type } from "arktype"
// ---cut---
// hover to see the type-level representation
const contact = type({
	// many common constraints are available as built-in keywords
	email: "email",
	// others can be written as type-safe expressions
	score: "integer < 100"
})

// if you need the TS type, just infer it out
type Contact = typeof contact.infer
// ---cut-start---
// this empty line prevents the source syntax highlighting from breaking

// ---cut-end---
```

## Compose

Imagine we want to define a new Type representing a non-empty list of `contact`s.

While the expression syntax we've been using is ideal for creating new types, chaining is a great way to refine or transform existing ones.

```ts
import { type } from "arktype"

const _Contact = type({
	email: "email",
	score: "integer < 100"
})

type _Contact = typeof _Contact.t

interface Contact extends _User {}

export const user: Type<User> = _user
// ---cut---

// a non-empty list of Contacts
const contacts = contact.array().atLeastLength(1)
```
