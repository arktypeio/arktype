TypeScript is extremely versatile for representing types like `string` or `number`, but what about `email` or `integer less than 100`?

In ArkType, conditions that narrow a type beyond its **basis** are called **constraints**.

Constraints are a first-class citizen of ArkType. They are fully composable with TypeScript's built-in operators and governed by the same underlying principles of set-theory.

In other words, **they just work**.

## Define

Let's create a new `contact` Type that enforces our example constraints.

```ts
import { type } from "arktype"
// ---cut---
// hover to see the type-level representation
const contact = type({
	// many common constraints are available as built-in keywords
	email: "email",
	// others can be written as type-safe expressions
	score: "integer < 100"
})

// if you need the TS type, just infer it out as normal
type Contact = typeof contact.infer
// ---cut-start---
// this empty line prevents the source syntax highlighting from breaking

// ---cut-end---
```

## Compose

Imagine we want to define a new Type representing a non-empty list of `Contact`.

While the expression syntax we've been using is ideal for creating new types, chaining is a great way to refine or transform existing ones.

```ts
import { type, type Type } from "arktype"

const _contact = type({
	email: "email",
	score: "integer < 100"
})

type _Contact = typeof _contact.t

interface Contact extends _Contact {}

export const contact: Type<Contact> = _contact
// ---cut---
// a non-empty list of Contact
const contacts = contact.array().atLeastLength(1)
```

## Narrow

Structured constraints like divisors and ranges will only take us so far. Luckily, they integrate seamlessly with whatever custom validation logic you need.

```ts
import { type, type Type } from "arktype"

const _contact = type({
	email: "email",
	score: "integer < 100"
})

type _Contact = typeof _contact.t

interface Contact extends _Contact {}

export const contact: Type<Contact> = _contact
// ---cut---
const goodContact = contact.narrow((data, ctx) => {
	if (data.score > 75 || data.email.endsWith("@arktype.io")) {
		return true
	}
	// add a customizable error and return false
	return ctx.mustBe("a better contact")
})

const out = goodContact({
	email: "david@gmail.com",
	score: 60
})

if (out instanceof type.errors) {
	console.error(out.summary)
} else {
	console.log(out.email)
}
```

You now know how to refine your types to enforce additional constraints at runtime (see the full list [here](/reference/constraints)).

Once your input is fully validated, you still need to make some adjustments before it's ready to use in your code?

The final section of intro will cover **morphs**, an extremely powerful tool for composing and transforming Types.
