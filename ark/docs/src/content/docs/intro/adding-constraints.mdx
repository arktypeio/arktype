We're still working on our new docs, as evidenced by the fact that they are not done.

TypeScript is extremely versatile for representing types like `string` or `number`, but what about `email` or `positive integer less than 100`?

In ArkType, conditions that narrow a type beyond its **basis** are called **constraints**.

Constraints are a first-class citizen of ArkType. They are fully composable with TypeScript's built-in operators and governed by the same underlying principles of set-theory.

In other words, **they just work**.

## Syntax

```ts
import { type } from "arktype"
// ---cut---
const contact = type({
	// many common constraints are available as built-in keywords
	email: "email",
	// others can be chained or written in type-safe expressions
	score: "1 <= integer < 100"
})
```
