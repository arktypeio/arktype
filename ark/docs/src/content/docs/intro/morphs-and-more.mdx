Sometimes, data at the boundaries of your code requires more than validation before it's ready to use.

**Morphs** allow you to arbitrarily transform the shape and format of your data.

Morphs can be **piped** before, after or between validators and even chained to other morphs.

```ts
import { type } from "arktype"
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs"
// ---cut---
// hover to see the type-level representation
const parseJson = type("string").pipe(s => JSON.parse(s))

const out = parseJson("{  }")
```

We're still working on our new docs, as evidenced by the fact that they are not done.
