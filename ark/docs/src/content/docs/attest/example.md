Guides lead a user through a specific task they want to accomplish, often with a sequence of steps.
Writing a good guide requires thinking about what your users are trying to do.

## Why use it?

- Performance:
  - In editor: Types are 3x more efficient than Zod
  - At runtime: 400x faster than Zod, 2000x faster than Yup
- Concision:
  - Definitions: About 1/2 as long as equivalent Zod on average
  - Types: Tooltips are 1/5 the length of Zod on average
- Portability: Definitions are just strings and objects and are serializable by default.
- Developer Experience: With semantic validation and contextual autocomplete, ArkType's static parser is unlike anything you've ever seen.

Also...

- Deeply-computed intersections
- Automatically discriminated unions
- Clear, customizable error messages
- Recursive and cyclic types that can check cyclic data
