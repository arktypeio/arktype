## What awaits

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Unparalleled DX" icon="seti:tsconfig">
		Type syntax you already know with safety and completions unlike anything
		you've ever seen
		<TsBlock code={unparalleledDxSrc} />
	</Card>
	<Card title="Faster... everything" icon="rocket">
		100x faster than Zod at runtime with editor performance that will remind you
		how autocomplete is supposed to feel
		<Tabs>
			<TabItem label="Runtime">
				<RuntimeBenchmarksGraph />
			</TabItem>
			<TabItem label="Editor">
				<TypeBenchmarksGraph />
			</TabItem>
		</Tabs>
	</Card>
	<Card title="Clarity and Concision" icon="comment-alt">
		Definitions are half as long, type errors are twice as readable, and hovers
		tell you just what really matters
		<TsBlock code={clearAndConciseSrc} />
	</Card>
	<Card title="Better Errors" icon="error">
		Deeply customizable messages with great defaults
		<TsBlock code={betterErrorsSrc} />
	</Card>
	<Card title="Deep Introspectability" icon="seti:code-search">
		ArkType uses set theory to understand and expose the relationships between
		your types at runtime the way TypeScript does at compile time
		<TsBlock code={deepIntrospectability} />
	</Card>
	<Card title="Intrinsic Optimization" icon="seti:smarty">
		Every schema is internally normalized and reduced to its purest and fastest
		representation
		<TsBlock code={intrinsicOptimization} />
	</Card>
	{/* <Card title="Portable" icon="seti:json">
		Most definitions are just objects and strings- take them across the stack or
		even outside JS altogether
	</Card> */}
</CardGrid>
