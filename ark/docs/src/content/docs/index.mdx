## v2 is coming

Thank you for all the wonderful feedback on our v1 release. Basic docs for that can be found [here]().

However, most of our effort has been diverted to shipping an ambitious v2 release that will establish a stable, well-documented foundation for ArkType not just as a best-in-class validator, but as the first true runtime type system for JavaScript.

We coudn't be more excited to share it with you.
