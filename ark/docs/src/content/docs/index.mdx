## What awaits

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Unparalleled DX" icon="seti:tsconfig">
		Type syntax you already know with safety unlike anything you've ever seen
	</Card>
	<Card title="Faster. Everywhere." icon="rocket">
		[100x faster than
		Zod](https://moltar.github.io/typescript-runtime-type-benchmarks/) with
		editor performance that will remind you how autocomplete is supposed to feel
	</Card>
	<Card title="Clear and concise" icon="comment-alt">
		Schemas are half as long and twice as readable with hovers that tell you
		just what really matters
	</Card>
	<Card title="Better errors" icon="error">
		Deeply customizable and composable messages with great defaults
	</Card>
	<Card title="Deeply introspectable" icon="seti:code-search">
		ArkType uses set theory to understand and expose the relationships between
		your types at runtime the way TypeScript does at compile time
	</Card>
	<Card title="Smarter by default" icon="seti:smarty">
		Every schema you define is internally optimized to provide the clearest,
		fastest validation possible
	</Card>
	{/* <Card title="Portable" icon="seti:json">
		Most definitions are just objects and strings- take them across the stack or
		even outside JS altogether
	</Card> */}
</CardGrid>
