### Why do I see type errors in an ArkType package in `node_modules`?

This can occur due to incompatibilities between your `tsconfig.json` and ours. It is totally harmless as long as your types are correct in source.

We highly recommend enabling [`skipLibCheck`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#skipLibCheck) in every TypeScript project to avoid false negatives like this and greatly improve editor performance.

### Is there a way to create an async morph?

Other than handling it as a promise on the output object, no.

As it stands, it doesn't seem worth the significant complexity it would add to morphs in the type system.

If you have a compelling use case, let us know on [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/462).
