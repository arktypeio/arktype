### Why do I see type errors in an ArkType package in `node_modules`?

This can occur due to incompatibilities between your `tsconfig.json` and ours. It is totally harmless as long as your types are correct in source.

We highly recommend enabling [`skipLibCheck`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#skipLibCheck) in every TypeScript project to avoid false negatives like this and greatly improve editor performance.
