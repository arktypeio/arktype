title: Adding Constraints
---

TypeScript is extremely versatile for representing types like `string` or `number`, but what about `email` or `integer less than 100`?

In ArkType, conditions that narrow a type beyond its **basis** are called **constraints**.

Constraints are a first-class citizen of ArkType. They are fully composable with TypeScript's builtin operators and governed by the same underlying principles of set-theory.

## Define

Let's create a new `contact` Type that enforces our example constraints.

```ts
const contact = type({
	// many common constraints are available as builtin keywords
	email: "string.email",
	// others can be written as type-safe expressions
	score: "number.integer < 100"
})

// if you need the TS type, just infer it out as normal
type Contact = typeof contact.infer
```

## Compose

Imagine we want to define a new Type representing a non-empty list of `Contact`.

While the expression syntax we've been using is ideal for creating new types, chaining is a great way to refine or transform existing ones.

```ts
const _contact = type({
	email: "string.email",
	score: "number.integer < 100"
})

type _Contact = typeof _contact.t

interface Contact extends _Contact {}

export const contact: type<Contact> = _contact
// ---cut-start---
// a non-empty list of Contact
// ---cut-end---
const contacts = contact.array().atLeastLength(1)
```

## Narrow

Structured constraints like divisors and ranges will only take us so far. Luckily, they integrate seamlessly with whatever custom validation logic you need.

```ts
interface RuntimeErrors extends type.errors {
	/**even must be even (was 7)
odd must be odd (was 8)*/
	summary: string
}

const narrowMessage = (e: type.errors): e is RuntimeErrors => true
// ---cut---

// there's no "not divisible" expression - need to narrow
const odd = type("number").narrow((n, ctx) =>
	// if even, add a customizable error and return false
	n % 2 === 0 ? ctx.mustBe("odd") : true
)

const favoriteNumbers = type({
	even: "number % 2",
	odd
})

const out = favoriteNumbers({
	even: 7,
	odd: 8
})

if (out instanceof type.errors) {
	// ---cut-start---
	if (!narrowMessage(out)) throw new Error()
	// ---cut-end---
	// hover summary to see validation errors
	console.error(out.summary)
} else {
	console.log(out.odd)
}
```

You now know how to refine your types to enforce additional constraints at runtime.

But what if once your input is fully validated, you still need to make some adjustments before it's ready to use?

The final section of intro will cover **morphs**, an extremely powerful tool for composing and transforming Types.
