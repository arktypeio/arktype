title: Configuration
---

A great out-of-the-box experience is a core goal of ArkType, including safe defaults and helpful messages for complex errors.

However, it's equally important that when you need different behavior, you can easily configure it with the right granularity.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Level</th>
      <th>Applies To</th>
      <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>**default**</td>
      <td>built-in defaults for all Types</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**global**</td>
      <td>all Types parsed after the config is applied</td>
      <td>
```ts title="config.ts"
import { configure } from "arktype/config"
// use the "arktype/config" entrypoint
configure({ numberAllowsNaN: true })
```

```ts title="app.ts"
import "./config.ts"
// import your config file before your arktype!
import { type } from "arktype"

type.number.allows(Number.NaN) // true
```

     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**scope**</td>
      <td>all Types parsed in the configured Scope</td>
      <td>

```ts
const myScope = scope(
	{ user: { age: "number < 100" } },
	{
		max: {
			actual: () => "unacceptably large"
		}
	}
)
const types = myScope.export()
// ArkErrors: age must be less than 100 (was unacceptably large)
types.user({ name: "Alice", age: 101 })
const parsedAfter = myScope.type({
	age: "number <= 100"
})
// ArkErrors: age must be at most 100 (was unacceptably large)
parsedAfter({ age: 101 })
```

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>**type**</td>
      <td>all Types shallowly referenced by the configured Type</td>
      <td>

```ts
// avoid logging "was xxx" for password
const password = type("string >= 8").configure({ actual: () => "" })
const user = type({
	email: "string.email",
	password
})
// ArkErrors: password must be at least length 8
const out = user({
	email: "david@arktype.io",
	password: "ez123"
})
```

      </td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

Some options only apply at specific levels, as reflected in the corresponding input types.

<Callout
	type="warn"
	title='Use the `"arktype/config"` entrypoint in a separate file for global config!'
>
	If you need your config to apply to built-in keywords (important for options
	like `jitless`, `numberAllowsNaN`, `dateAllowsInvalid`), you should import and
	`configure` from `"arktype/config"` before importing anything from
	`"arktype"`.

Otherwise, keywords will have already been parsed by the time your config applies!

### Errors

To allow custom errors to be integrated seemlessly with built-in logic for composite errors (i.e. `union` and `intersection`), ArkType supports a set of composable options:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>optional</th>
<th>description</th>
<th>example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>**description**</td>
<td>
‚úÖ a summary of the constraint that could complete the phrase "must be ___"

ü•á reused by other metadata and should be your first go-to for customizing a message

</td>
<td>
```ts
const password = type.string.atLeastLength(8).describe("a valid password")
// ArkErrors: must be a valid password
const out = password("ez123")
```
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>**expected**</td>
<td>
‚úÖ a function accepting the error context and returning a string of the format "must be ___"

‚úÖ specific to errors and takes precedence over `description` in those cases

</td>
    <td>
```ts
const password = type.string.atLeastLength(8).configure({
	expected: ctx =>
		ctx.code === "minLength" ? `${ctx.rule} characters or better` : "way better"
})
// ArkErrors: must be 8 characters or better (was 5)
const out1 = password("ez123").toString()
// ArkErrors: must be way better (was a number)
const out2 = password(12345678).toString()
```
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>**actual**</td>
<td>
‚úÖ a function accepting the data that caused the error and returning a string of the format "(was ___)"

‚úÖ if an empty string is returned, the actual portion of the message will be omitted

</td>
    <td>
```ts
const password = type("string >= 8").configure({ actual: () => "" })
// ArkErrors: password must be at least length 8
const out = password("ez123")
```
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>**problem**</td>
<td>
‚úÖ a function accepting the results of `expected` and `actual` in addition to other context and returning a complete description of the problem like "must be a string (was a number)"

‚ùå may not apply to composite errors like unions

</td>
<td>
```ts
const password = type("string >= 8").configure({
	problem: ctx => `${ctx.actual} isn't ${ctx.expected}`
})
// ArkErrors: 5 isn't at least length 8
const out1 = password("ez123")
// ArkErrors: a number isn't a string
const out2 = password(12345678)
```
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>**message**</td>
<td>
‚úÖ a function accepting the result of `problem` in addition to other context and returning a complete description of the problem including the path at which it occurred

‚ùå may not apply to composite errors like unions

</td>
<td>
```ts
const user = type({
	password: "string >= 8"
}).configure({
	message: ctx =>
		`${ctx.propString || "(root)"}: ${ctx.actual} isn't ${ctx.expected}`
})
// ArkErrors: (root): a string isn't an object
const out1 = user("ez123")
// `.configure` only applies shallowly, so the nested error isn't changed!
// ArkErrors: password must be at least length 8 (was 5)
const out2 = user({ password: "ez123" })
```
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### By Code

Errors can also be configured by their associated `code` property at a _scope_ or _global_ level.

For example:

```ts
const mod = type.module(
	{ isEven: "number%2" },
	{
		divisor: {
			// the available `ctx` types will include data specific to your errors
			expected: ctx => `% ${ctx.rule} !== 0`,
			problem: ctx => `${ctx.actual} ${ctx.expected}`
		}
	}
)
// ArkErrors: 3 % 2 !== 0
mod.isEven(3)
```

#### ArkErrors

For use cases like i18n that fall outside the scope of this composable message config, the `ArkErrors` array returned on validation failure contains `ArkError` instances that can be discriminated via calls like `.hasCode("divisor")` and contain contextual data specific to that error type as well as getters for each composable error part.

These `ArkError` instances can be arbitrarily transformed and composed with an internationalization library. This is still a topic we're working on investigating and documenting, so please reach out with any questions or feedback!

### Clone

By default, before a [morph](/docs/intro/morphs-and-more) is applied, ArkType will deeply clone the original input value with a built-in `deepClone` function that tries to make reasonable assumptions about preserving prototypes etc. The implementation of `deepClone` can be found [here](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/blob/main/ark/util/clone.ts).

You can provide an alternate clone implementation to the `clone` config option.

```ts
import { configure } from "arktype/config"

configure({ clone: structuredClone })

import { type } from "arktype"

// will now create a new object using structuredClone
const userForm = type({
	age: "string.numeric.parse"
})
```

To mutate the input object directly, you can set the `clone` config option to `false`.

```ts
import { configure } from "arktype/config"

configure({ clone: false })

import { type } from "arktype"

const userForm = type({
	age: "string.numeric.parse"
})

const formData = {
	age: "42"
}

const out = userForm(formData)

// the original object's age key is now a number
console.log(formData.age)
```

### onUndeclaredKey

Like TypeScript, ArkType defaults to ignoring undeclared keys during validation. However, it also supports two additional behaviors:

- `"ignore"` (default): Allow undeclared keys on input, preserve them on output
- `"delete"`: Allow undeclared keys on input, delete them before returning output
- `"reject"`: Reject input with undeclared keys

These behaviors can be associated with individual Types via the builtin `"+"` syntax (see [those docs](/docs/objects/properties-undeclared) for more on how they work). You can also change the default globally:

```ts
import { configure } from "arktype/config"

configure({ onUndeclaredKey: "delete" })

import { type } from "arktype"

const userForm = type({
	name: "string"
})

// out is now { name: "Alice" }
const out = userForm({
	name: "Alice",
	age: "42"
})
```

### jitless

By default, when a `Type` is instantiated, ArkType will precompile optimized validation logic that will run when the type is invoked. This behavior is disabled by default in environments that don't support `new Function`, e.g. Cloudflare Workers.

If you'd like to opt out of it for another reason, you can set the `jitless` config option to `true`.

```ts
import { configure } from "arktype/config"

configure({ jitless: true })

import { type } from "arktype"

// will not be precompiled
const myObject = type({
	foo: "string"
})
```

### custom

```ts
// add this anywhere in your project
declare global {
	interface ArkEnv {
		meta(): {
			// meta properties should always be optional
			secretIngredient?: string
		}
	}
}

// now types you define can specify and access your metadata
const mrPingsSecretIngredientSoup = type({
	broth: "'miso' | 'vegetable'",
	ingredients: "string[]"
}).configure({ secretIngredient: "nothing!" })
```
