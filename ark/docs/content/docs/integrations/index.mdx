### Standard Schema

ArkType is proud to support and co-author the new [Standard Schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema) API with [Valibot](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot) and [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).

Standard Schema allows you and your dependencies to integrate library-agnostic validation logic. If you're building or maintaining a library with a peer dependency on ArkType and/or other validation libraries, we'd recommend consuming it through Standard Schema's API if possible so that your users can choose the solution that best suits their needs!

### tRPC

ArkType can easily be used with tRPC via the `assert` prop:

```ts
// @noErrors
t.procedure.input(
	type({
		name: "string",
		"age?": "number"
	}).assert
)
```

### react-hook-form

react-hook-form has builtin support for ArkType via [`@hookform/resolvers`](https://github.com/react-hook-form/resolvers/tree/master):

```ts
// @noErrors
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form"
import { arktypeResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/arktype"
import { type } from "arktype"

const user = type({
	firstName: "string",
	age: "number.integer > 0"
})

// in your component
const {
	register,
	handleSubmit,
	formState: { errors }
} = useForm({
	resolver: arktypeResolver(user)
})
```

### hono

Hono has builtin support for ArkType via [`@hono/arktype-validator`](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/tree/main/packages/arktype-validator):

```ts
// @noErrors
const user = type({
	name: "string",
	age: "number"
})

app.post("/author", arktypeValidator("json", user), c => {
	const data = c.req.valid("json")
	return c.json({
		success: true,
		message: `${data.name} is ${data.age}`
	})
})
```

[`hono-openapi`](https://github.com/rhinobase/hono-openapi) also offers experimental support for OpenAPI docgen.

### oRPC

[oRPC](https://orpc.unnoq.com/) has built-in support for Standard Schema, so ArkType works seamlessly right out of the box:

```ts
// @noErrors
os.input(
	type({
		name: "string",
		"age?": "number"
	})
)
```
