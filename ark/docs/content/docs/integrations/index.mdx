### Standard Schema

ArkType is proud to support and co-author the new [Standard Schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema) API with [Valibot](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot) and [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).

Standard Schema allows you and your dependencies to integrate library-agnostic validation logic. If you're building or maintaining a library with a peer dependency on ArkType and/or other validation libraries, we'd recommend consuming it through Standard Schema's API if possible so that your users can choose the solution that best suits their needs!

### tRPC

ArkType can easily be used with tRPC via the `assert` prop:

```ts
// @noErrors
t.procedure.input(
	type({
		name: "string",
		"age?": "number"
	}).assert
)
```
