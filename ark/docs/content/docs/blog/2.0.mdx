As of today, `arktype@2.0.0` is generally available and fully stable.

ArkType 2.0 brings types to runtime JS in a way that, until today, was a pipedream. Whether you're a first-time TypeScript dev trying to validate a form or a library author introspecting relationships, ArkType offers fundamentally better tools for navigating the perils of JavaScript.

### Unparalleled DX

Type syntax you already know with safety and completions unlike anything
you&apos;ve ever seen

<CodeBlock fromFile="unparalleledDx" includesCompletions />

### Faster... everything

100x faster than Zod at runtime with editor performance that will remind you
how autocomplete is supposed to feel

<RuntimeBenchmarksGraph className="mt-2" />

### Clarity and Concision

Definitions are half as long, type errors are twice as readable, and hovers
tell you just what really matters

<CodeBlock fromFile="clarityAndConcision" />

### Better Errors

Deeply customizable messages with great defaults

<CodeBlock fromFile="betterErrors" />

### Deep Introspectability

ArkType uses set theory to understand and expose the relationships between
your types at runtime the way TypeScript does at compile time

<CodeBlock fromFile="deepIntrospectability" />

### Intrinsic Optimization

Every schema is internally normalized and reduced to its purest and fastest
representation

<CodeBlock fromFile="intrinsicOptimization" />
