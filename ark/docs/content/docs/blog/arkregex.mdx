title: Announcing arkregex
description: A drop-in replacement for new RegExp() with types
---

As of today, `arktype@2.0.0` is generally available and fully stable.

ArkType 2.0 brings types to runtime JS in a way that, until today, has been a pipedream.

Whether you're a first-time TypeScript dev trying to validate a form or a library author introspecting relationships, ArkType offers fundamentally better tools for navigating the perils of JavaScript.

### What next?

ArkType doesn't require a special environment or build step to work- [our intro](/docs/intro/setup) will have you up and running in seconds.

We have [big plans](https://github.com/orgs/arktypeio/projects/4) to ArkType 2.0 even further, but we're even more excited to see what you do with it!
