# @arktype/type

<h4>
    <i>Type-first validation from editor to runtime🧬</i>
</h4>

A model is a way to create universal types for your JS/TS values. From one definition, you get all the benefits of [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) in your editor and build and a validator like [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) or [JOI](https://github.com/sideway/joi) at runtime.

## Installation 📦

`npm install @arktype/type`

(feel free to substitute `yarn`, `pnpm`, et al.)

If you're using TypeScript, you'll need at least `4.4`.

## Start quick ⏱️

This snippet will give you an idea of `@arktype/type` syntax. Try messing around with the `user` definition below and see how the type hints help guide you in the right direction.
