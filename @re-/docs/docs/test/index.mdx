# Test

## Under Construction

Do you love writing automated UI test?

Neither do we. They're boring, flaky and repetitive.

That's why we're building a tool that generates simple, maintainable JSON to represent your app's UI and tests it for you.

If you want to learn more, the project is tracked [here](https://github.com/re-do/re-po/projects/1).

If you're interested in contributing, check out our guide [here](https://github.com/re-do/re-po/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) or, if you really want to make my day, reach out to [david@redo.dev](mailto:david@redo.dev). I'd love to talk about your ideas or suggest issues that might be a good fit! ðŸ˜»
