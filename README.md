Building something great requires good tests, but it shouldn't be your job to automate, run, or maintain them. [Redo](https://redo.qa) learns how your app works and does all that for you.

-   [@re-do/app](/pkgs/app): Desktop UI for creating and managing automated tests 🤖
-   [statelessly](pkgs/statelessly): 💪-typed state management with simple shapes🔷
