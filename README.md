## What is it?

<!-- @snipStart:intro -->

<p>ArkType is a validation library that can infer TypeScript definitions 1:1 and reuse them as highly-optimized validators for your data at runtime.

With each character your type, your editor will show you either:

-   a list of completions
-   a detailed ParseError
-   a type-safe validator

All powered by ArkType's lightning-fast type-level parser- no plugins or dependencies required.</p>

<!-- @snipEnd -->

```ts @blockFrom:dev/examples/type.ts
import { type } from "arktype"

// Definitions are statically parsed and inferred as TS.
export const user = type({
    name: "string",
    device: {
        platform: "'android'|'ios'",
        "version?": "number"
    }
})

// Validators return typed data or clear, customizable errors.
export const { data, problems } = user({
    name: "Alan Turing",
    device: {
        // problems.summary: "device/platform must be 'android' or 'ios' (was 'enigma')"
        platform: "enigma"
    }
})
```

## Why use it?

-   Performance:
    -   In editor: Types are 3x more efficient than Zod
    -   At runtime: 400x faster than Zod, 2000x faster than Yup
-   Concision:
    -   Definitions: About 1/2 as long as equivalent Zod on average
    -   Types: Tooltips are 1/5 the length of Zod on average
-   Portability: Definitions are just strings and objects and are serializable by default.
-   Developer Experience: With semantic validation and contextual autocomplete, ArkType's static parser is unlike anything you've ever seen.

Also...

-   Deeply-computed intersections
-   Automatically discriminated unions
-   Clear, customizable error messages
-   Recursive and cyclic types that can check cyclic data

## Install <sub><sub>ðŸ“¦`12KB` gzipped, `0` dependencies</sub></sub>

<img src="./dev/arktype.io/static/img/npm.svg" alt="Npm Icon" height="16px" /> <code>npm install arktype</code>
<sub>(or whatever package manager you prefer)</sub>
<br />

Our types are tested in [strict-mode](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict) with TypeScript versions `4.8`, `4.9`, and `5.0`.

_Our primary APIs have stabilized, but details may still shift during the beta stage of our 1.0 release. If you have suggestions that may require a breaking change, now is the time to let us know!_ â›µ

### Scopes

[Try this example in-browser.](https://arktype.io/docs/scopes)

```ts @blockFrom:dev/examples/scope.ts
import { scope } from "arktype"

// Scopes are collections of types that can reference each other.
export const types = scope({
    package: {
        name: "string",
        "dependencies?": "package[]",
        "contributors?": "contributor[]"
    },
    contributor: {
        // Subtypes like 'email' are inferred like 'string' but provide additional validation at runtime.
        email: "email",
        "packages?": "package[]"
    }
}).compile()

// Cyclic types are inferred to arbitrary depth...
export type Package = typeof types.package.infer

// And can validate cyclic data.
const packageData: Package = {
    name: "arktype",
    dependencies: [{ name: "typescript" }],
    contributors: [{ email: "david@sharktypeio" }]
}
packageData.dependencies![0].dependencies = [packageData]

export const { data, problems } = types.package(packageData)
```

<!-- TODO: Examples mapped to here, and on website. On website, most examples would be a code block by deafult but would have a button like the one on the homepage to turn it into a StackBlitz demo. -->

## Syntax

This is an informal, non-exhaustive list of current and upcoming ArkType syntax.

There are some subjects it doesn't cover, primarily tuple expressions and scopes. As mentioned below, keep an eye out for comprehensive docs coming with the upcoming beta release. In the meantime, join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/xEzdc3fJQC) or head to our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/discussions) to ask a question and there's a good chance you'll see a response within the hour ðŸ˜Š

```ts
export const currentTsSyntax = type({
    keyword: "null",
    stringLiteral: "'TS'",
    numberLiteral: "5",
    bigintLiteral: "5n",
    union: "string|number",
    intersection: "boolean&true",
    array: "Date[]",
    grouping: "(0|1)[]",
    objectLiteral: {
        nested: "string",
        "optional?": "number"
    },
    tuple: ["number", "number"]
})

// these features will be available in the upcoming release

export const upcomingTsSyntax = type({
    keyof: "keyof bigint",
    thisKeyword: "this", // recurses to the root of the current type
    variadicTuples: ["true", "...false[]"]
})

export const validationSyntax = type({
    keywords: "email|uuid|creditCard|integer", // and many more
    builtinParsers: "parsedDate", // parses a Date from a string
    nativeRegexLiteral: /@arktype\.io/,
    embeddedRegexLiteral: "email&/@arktype\\.io/",
    divisibility: "number%10", // a multiple of 10
    bound: "alpha>10", // an alpha-only string with more than 10 characters
    range: "1<=email[]<99", // a list of 1 to 99 emails
    narrows: ["number", "=>", (n) => n % 2 === 1], // an odd integer
    morphs: ["string", "|>", parseFloat] // validates a string input then parses it to a number
})

// in the upcoming release, you can use chaining to define expressions directly
// that use objects or functions that can't be embedded in strings

export const parseBigintLiteral = type({ value: "string" })
    .and({
        format: "'bigint'"
    })
    .narrow((data): data is { value: `${string}n`; format: "bigint" } =>
        data.value.endsWith("n")
    )
    .morph((data) => BigInt(data.value.slice(-1)))

export const { data, problems } = parseBigintLiteral("999n")
//             ^ bigint | undefined
```

## API

<!--@snipStart:api -->

ArkType supports many of TypeScript's built-in types and operators, as well as some new ones dedicated exclusively to runtime validation. In fact, we got a little ahead of ourselves and built a ton of cool features, but we're still working on getting caught up syntax and API docs. Keep an eye out for more in the next couple weeks â›µ

In the meantime, check out the examples here and use the type hints you get to learn how you can customize your types and scopes. If you want to explore some of the more advanced features, take a look at [our unit tests](./dev/test) or ask us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/xEzdc3fJQC) if your functionality is supported. If not, [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/new) so we can prioritize it!

## Integrations

### react-hook-form

### tRPC

ArkType can easily be used with tRPC via the `assert` prop:

```ts
...
t.procedure
  .input(
    type({
      name: "string",
      "age?": "number"
    }).assert
  )
...
```

## How?

ArkType's mirrored static and dynamic parsers means the feedback you get in your IDE is the same as the eventual parse result at runtime.

If you're curious, below is an example of what that looks like under the hood. If not, just close that hood back up, `npm install arktype` and enjoy top-notch developer experienceðŸ”¥

```ts
export const parseOperator = (s: DynamicStateWithRoot): void => {
    const lookahead = s.scanner.shift()
    return lookahead === ""
        ? s.finalize()
        : lookahead === "["
        ? s.scanner.shift() === "]"
            ? s.setRoot(s.root.toArray())
            : s.error(incompleteArrayTokenMessage)
        : lookahead === "|" || lookahead === "&"
        ? s.pushRootToBranch(lookahead)
        : lookahead === ")"
        ? s.finalizeGroup()
        : isKeyOf(lookahead, comparatorStartChars)
        ? parseBound(s, lookahead)
        : lookahead === "%"
        ? parseDivisor(s)
        : lookahead === " "
        ? parseOperator(s)
        : throwInternalError(writeUnexpectedCharacterMessage(lookahead))
}

export type parseOperator<s extends StaticState> =
    s["unscanned"] extends Scanner.shift<infer lookahead, infer unscanned>
        ? lookahead extends "["
            ? unscanned extends Scanner.shift<"]", infer nextUnscanned>
                ? state.setRoot<s, [s["root"], "[]"], nextUnscanned>
                : error<incompleteArrayTokenMessage>
            : lookahead extends "|" | "&"
            ? state.reduceBranch<s, lookahead, unscanned>
            : lookahead extends ")"
            ? state.finalizeGroup<s, unscanned>
            : lookahead extends ComparatorStartChar
            ? parseBound<s, lookahead, unscanned>
            : lookahead extends "%"
            ? parseDivisor<s, unscanned>
            : lookahead extends " "
            ? parseOperator<state.scanTo<s, unscanned>>
            : error<writeUnexpectedCharacterMessage<lookahead>>
        : state.finalize<s>
```
