## repo

We use a [pnpm workspace](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) to manage our packages. You might want to make changes to one or more of them depending on the goals of your contribution. Take a look at any of them individually to learn more:

-   [@arktype/io](@arktype/io): Type-first validation from editor to runtime üß¨

You might also find parts of these packages useful, but they are mostly for internal use and/or are missing documentation:

-   [@arktype/assert](@arktype/assert): Seamless testing for types and code ‚úÖ
-   [@arktype/tools](@arktype/tools): Lightweight utilities and types shared across Redo packages üß∞
-   [@arktype/node](@arktype/node): Node-based utilities, scripts, and configs for Redo packages ‚öôÔ∏è
-   [arktype.io](./arktype.io): Source code for [arktype.io](https://arktype.io) üîÅ
