# A demo of `react-markdown`

`react-markdown` is a markdown component for React.

üëâ Changes are re-rendered as you type.

üëà Try writing some markdown on the left.

## Overview

-   Follows [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org)
-   Optionally follows [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
-   Renders actual React elements instead of using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
-   Lets you define your own components (to render `MyHeading` instead of `h1`)
-   Has a lot of plugins

## Table of contents

Here is an example of a plugin in action
([`remark-toc`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc)).
This section is replaced by an actual table of contents.

## Syntax highlighting

Here is an example of a plugin to highlight code:
[`rehype-highlight`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight).

```js
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"
import Markdown from "react-markdown"
import rehypeHighlight from "rehype-highlight"

ReactDOM.render(
    <Markdown rehypePlugins={[rehypeHighlight]}>
        {"# Your markdown here"}
    </Markdown>,
    document.querySelector("#content")
)
```

Pretty neat, eh?

## GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)

For GFM, you can _also_ use a plugin:
[`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown#use).
It adds support for GitHub-specific extensions to the language:
tables, strikethrough, tasklists, and literal URLs.

These features **do not work by default**.
üëÜ Use the toggle above to add the plugin.

|    Feature | Support              |
| ---------: | :------------------- |
| CommonMark | 100%                 |
|        GFM | 100% w/ `remark-gfm` |

~~strikethrough~~

-   [ ] task list
-   [x] checked item

## HTML in markdown

‚ö†Ô∏è HTML in markdown is quite unsafe, but if you want to support it, you can
use [`rehype-raw`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw).
You should probably combine it with
[`rehype-sanitize`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-sanitize).

## Components

You can pass components to change things:

```js
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"
import Markdown from "react-markdown"
import MyFancyRule from "./components/my-fancy-rule.js"

ReactDOM.render(
    <Markdown
        components={{
            // Use h2s instead of h1s
            h1: "h2",
            // Use a component instead of hrs
            hr: ({ node, ...props }) => <MyFancyRule {...props} />
        }}
    >
        # Your markdown here
    </Markdown>,
    document.querySelector("#content")
)
```
