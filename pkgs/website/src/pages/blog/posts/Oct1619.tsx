                Earlier this year I left the best job I’ve ever had working on
                Alexa Devices to found Redo and build a better way for engineers
                to do UI testing. I had a lot of reasons for doing this, but
                ultimately a couple of ideas motivated the decision. First, I
                believe that dev teams are happier and more successful if they
                are able to focus on the unique problems their organization is
                trying to solve. UI tests, manual or automated, tend to require
                the same overhead work from every team wanting to run them. I
                began to realize what a huge market opportunity awaits whoever
                can define the next paradigm for end-to-end UI testing and that
                the experience I had was exceptionally relevant to that problem.

                Second, for years my personal happiness has been tied up in my
                belief that I am doing the most I can do to help others. More
                recently, I learned about{" "}
                <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/" target="_blank">
                    Effective Altruism
                </a>
                , which reinforced that connection as well as the idea that
                “earning to give” (optimizing your career decisions around
                making extra money you can donate) could be a viable path to
                maximizing my impact.

                I often try to make decisions based on what I imagine I’d want
                to have done in retrospect at some point in the future, and
                founding Redo began to feel like an opportunity that I would
                never forgive myself for missing. So I gave my two weeks at
                Amazon and did what I could to prepare myself. At this point,
                I’d read dozens of books about startups and spent years
                meticulously tracking my time and energy. I was on the verge of
                something I’d been building up to for most of my adult life, and
                I felt great. I anticipated challenges and acknowledged the
                statistical likelihood of my failure, but figured that my
                biggest threats would be tactical: competitors with more
                resources that could strategically outmaneuver me or tech
                problems I couldn’t solve fast enough. As it turns out, by far
                the hardest challenge I’ve faced so far had nothing to do with
                knowing what to do or how to do it; that vision has always felt
                spectacularly clear. It was simply that for the first time in my
                life, I often just felt totally miserable.

                At first, I didn’t want to acknowledge it. How was it possible
                that given the chance to do something I’d been working towards
                for years and having every reason to be optimistic, most days it
                was a struggle to get out of bed? Eventually, the stress started
                to manifest itself physically. For the first time in my life, I
                was getting chest pains and developing bizarre nervous habits.
                I’d often take deep breaths hoping exhalation would feel like a
                relief, but it just felt like there was this weight in my chest
                that was always there.

                Eventually, I knew I had to take a step back from the 100-hour
                weeks I’d been putting in since June and figure out what was
                going on. I started taking actual days off and planning small
                trips to try and reset. But when I’d sit down to get back to
                work, all the stress would just come rushing back. It felt
                totally debilitating, and the combination of that paralysis with
                the urgency of my desire to realize my vision led to the most
                painful experiences I’ve ever had.

                Luckily, my wife Savannah has been an amazing support through
                all of this and helped me maintain my belief in the tractability
                of these problems. So I’ve continued iterating on my routines
                and reflecting on how I ended up in this situation. And that’s
                about where I am today. Unfortunately, this isn’t a “There and
                Back Again” story-- yet. However, I do have some hypotheses I’m
                interested in testing.

                As a solo founder, I’ve been able to bypass many of the
                trickiest issues that most early-stage startup teams have to
                navigate. However, I was wrong in thinking the kind of hours I
                was working were sustainable based on passion alone. Despite
                being naturally extraverted, my goals have led to long periods
                of time spent with my head down, usually coding and often alone
                save the company of Savannah and my seven pets. That may have
                been fine when my projects had clear end dates, but running a
                startup doesn’t. Charging your phone once a day won’t work if
                you live in Antarctica and a day is six months. To do this I’ll
                need sustainable sources of energy that keep up with what I’m
                expending on a daily basis, and I’m hoping this blog will be one
                of them.

                So what do founding a startup and global warming have in common?
                They’re bad times to be an island. Were the references to
                Antarctica and sustainability meant to throw you off? Yes, so if
                you’re either full of resentment or just here because of the
                post’s title, you’re free to go.

                For the rest of you, each day, I plan to post a brief update on
                the company’s progress since the previous day and goals for
                tomorrow (a lot like a daily standup for those in software).
                Weekly, I’ll be posting something more like this focused on
                Redo’s broader strategy, my experience as a founder, or some
                combination of those. I hope that in sharing this with friends,
                family, and the tech/startup communities, my experiences,
                including and perhaps especially my failures, will be
                informative or entertaining (and hopefully not purely out of
                schadenfreude). Moreover, I’d encourage anyone with questions
                about Redo, founding a startup, Effective Altruism, bow ties, or
                anything else they read about to reach out (my contact info can
                be found at the bottom of the page). In doing so, in addition to
                some small chance of a genuinely helpful response, you will have
                helped the road I’m on feel a little less lonely. And when that
                road is all you can see, that feels like a very big deal.
