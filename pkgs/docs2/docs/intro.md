# Why Redo?

## Quick description

Redo will launch a browser you can use to interact with your website. Whenever you do something on your page, Redo learns how to perform that action automatically.

Redo will use your test and others you've saved to build a transparent, well-structured model of your app, just like an engineer would. You can run your tests anytime, anywhere, and get clear, deterministic results.

## Why Redo matters

We believe that automated end-to-end testing helps developers be more efficient and feel confident deploying iterations regularly, regardless of whether you are building a personal website or collaborating on a website with a team. 

We built Redo to make it seamless to develop, implement, and scale automated end-to-end tests.
