# Creating your first test

## Step 1: Launch Redo

After installing Redo and getting started [with Jest](/getting-started/getting-started-with-jest) or [with Mocha](/getting-started/getting-started-with-mocha), launch the Redo app from the command line with:

```bash
npx redo launch
```

## Step 2: Create an account

Redo is free and open source, and your data stays in your repo, not our servers. We ask for your email today so that we know who to contact to get feedback on the app.
