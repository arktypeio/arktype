# State

## Under Construction

We're working hard on a new tool that uses [models](/docs/model/intro) to make states that can manage themselves.

Think Redux but with less boilerplate, more flexibility, and implicit validation.

If you want to learn more, the project is tracked [here](https://github.com/re-do/re-po/projects/1).

If you're interested in contributing, check out our guide [here](https://github.com/re-do/re-po/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) or, if you really want to make my day, reach out to [david@redo.dev](mailto:david@redo.dev). I'd love to talk about your ideas or suggest issues that might be a good fit! ðŸ˜»
