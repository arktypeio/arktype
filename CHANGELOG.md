## 1.0.20-alpha

### Patch Changes

-   # Fixes a bug causing intersections including cross scope references to be inferred as `unknown`

    Unfortunately, some cross-scope operations will still result in an error at runtime. You will know at build time if this occurs by a message in an intersection like "Unable to resolve alias 'myExternalAlias'". The workaround is to use the in-scope type parser as follows until next release for these scenarios:

    Unions:

    ```ts
    const $ = scope({
        a: "'abc'",
        b: { "c?": "a" }
    })
    const types = $.compile()
    // This fails if you don't use scoped type for now, fixing in next release
    const t = $.type([types.b, "|", { extraProp: "string" }])
    ```

    Intersections:

    ```ts
    const $ = scope({
        a: "'abc'",
        b: { "c?": "a" }
    })
    const types = $.compile()
    // This fails if you don't use scoped type for now, fixing in next release
    const t = $.type([types.b, "&", { extraProp: "string" }])
    ```

## 1.0.19-alpha

### Patch Changes

-   Make types keep JSDoc for required keys

## 1.0.18-alpha

### Patch Changes

-   Fix build entrypoint paths

## 1.0.17-alpha

### Patch Changes

-   ci: revert to dual cjs+esm build output

## 1.0.16-alpha

### Patch Changes

-   fix: internal type error in compiled output

## 1.0.15-alpha

### Patch Changes

-   Fix a type error affecting users with skipLibCheck unset

## 1.0.14-alpha

### Patch Changes

-   ## add a syntax error when defining an expression with multiple right bounds

    Ensures expressions like the following result in a syntax error during type validation (will currently not throw at runtime):

    ```ts
    // Type Error: `Expression 'number' must have at most one right bound`
    const boundedNumber = type("number>0<=200")
    ```

-   ## fix array validation in strict and distilled modes

    Previously, attempting to validate an array with "keys" set to "distilled" or "strict" would yield incorrect results.

    Now, types like this behave as expected:

    ```ts
    const strictArray = type("string[]", { keys: "strict" })
    // data = ["foo", "bar"]
    const { data, problems } = strictArray(["foo", "bar"])
    ```

## 1.0.13-alpha

### Patch Changes

-   check all keys when in strict or distilled mode, even if one fails

## 1.0.12-alpha

### Patch Changes

-   ## fixed a bug causing array elements after the first failure not to be checked

    Previously, when checking an array, we'd bail out after the first failed element. Since all elements are at the same level, we should check each and provide problems when relevant, regardless of the validation result of previous elements (unless in failFast mode).

    Thanks to @PointSingularity for this repro (can be found in the associated issue, https://github.com/arktypeio/arktype/issues/710):

    ```ts
    import { type, scope } from "arktype"

    export const badType = type("number[]")
    export const { data, problems } = badType([1, 2, null, null])

    // count should be 2
    console.log("Problem count: ", problems?.count ?? 0)
    ```

-   ## allow a custom path to be specified when creating a problem using a string[]

    Previously, creating a problem at a custom Path from a narrow function required importing the Path utility, which is not exposed through the main API entrypoint. This allows path to be specified as a simple string[], e.g.:

    ```ts
    const abEqual = type([
        {
            a: "number",
            b: "number"
        },
        "=>",
        ({ a, b }, problems) => {
            if (a === b) {
                return true
            }
            problems.mustBe("equal to b", { path: ["a"] })
            problems.mustBe("equal to a", { path: ["b"] })
            return false
        }
    ])
    ```

## 1.0.11-alpha

### Patch Changes

-   ## remove String, Number, Boolean, Object and Array from the default jsObjects scope

    These types are a footgun in TypeScript. You almost always want to use `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object` or `unknown[]` instead. Particularly with the addition of autocomplete, we don't want to be confusing people by constantly suggesting `string` and `String`.

    If you do want to use them, you can still define them like any other `"instanceof"` type:

    ```ts
    const stringObject = type(["instanceof", String])
    ```

-   Thanks [@{](https://github.com/{)! - ## add autocomplete for string definitions

    Now, when you start typing a string definition, you'll see all valid completions for that definition based on the keywords in your current scope:

    ```ts
    type({
        // suggests all built-in keywords (good way to see what's available!)
        name: ""
    })

    type({
        // suggests "string" | "semver" | "symbol"
        name: "s"
    })

    type({
        // suggests "string"
        name: "str",
        // suggests "number|undefined" | "number|unknown"
        age: "number|un"
    })

    scope({

            name: "string",
            age: "number|undefined"
        },
        // suggests "user" | "undefined" | "unknown" | "uuid" | "uppercase"
        admin: "u"
    })
    ```

    Initially, I was hesitant to add funcitonality like this, because it sometimes leads to type errors like '"" is not assignable to ("string" | "number" | ...a bunch of keywords...)", which is significantly less clear than the previous message "'' is unresolvable."

    That said, the DX was just too good to pass up. Try it out and let me know if you agree ðŸ”¥

## 1.0.10-alpha

### Patch Changes

-   add "inferIn" prop for extracting type input

## 1.0.9-alpha

### Patch Changes

-   improve type summaries for tuple/array intersections

    This change improves the inferred types of array intersections including one or more tuples.

    ```ts
    const tupleAndArray = type([
        [{ a: "string" }],
        "&",
        [{ b: "boolean" }, "[]"]
    ])

    // Failed to preserve tuple when inferring result
    type PreviousResult = { a: string; b: boolean }[]

    // Correctly preserves tuple literal
    type UpdatedResult = [{ a: string; b: boolean }]
    ```

    Thanks to KingPhipps on Twitter for [the inspiration](https://twitter.com/KingPhipps/status/1635212259973795841?s=20)!

## 1.0.8-alpha

### Patch Changes

-   add an "assert" utility to type instances that either directly returns valid data or throws a TypeError

    ```ts
    const t = type("string")
    // "foo"
    const resultOne = t.assert("foo")
    // Throws: TypeError: Must be a string (was number)
    const resultTwo = t.assert(5)
    ```

## 1.0.7-alpha

### Patch Changes

-   Allow discrimination between common builtin classes

    Previously, types like the following were incorrectly treated as non-discriminatable unions:

    ```ts
    const arrayOrDate = type([["instanceof", Array], "|", ["instanceof", Date]])

    attest(t.flat).snap([
        ["domain", "object"],
        // Whoops! Should have been a switch based on "class"
        [
            "branches",
            [[["class", "(function Array)"]], [["class", "(function Date)"]]]
        ]
    ])
    ```

    Now, unions like these are correctly discriminated if they occur anywhere in the type:

    ```ts
    const arrayOrDate = type([["instanceof", Array], "|", ["instanceof", Date]])

    attest(t.flat).snap([
        ["domain", "object"],
        // Correctly able to determine which branch we are on in constant time
        ["switch", { path: [], kind: "class", cases: { Array: [], Date: [] } }]
    ])
    ```
